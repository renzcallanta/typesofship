<h2>Flying bridge</h2>

<p>
It is an extended area on top of a weather deck or an open area of the superstructure, 
which provides an unobstructed view of the fwd and aft along with the vessel’s sides to the navigational officers.
</p>

<p>
It also serves as an operating station for the officer and crew of the watch.
</p>

<p>
It also contains a duplicate set of controls, which is vital for the master, ship’s officers, and pilot for berthing and unberthing the vessel.
